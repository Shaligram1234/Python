## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy (`numpy`)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-mask-detection.git
   cd face-mask-detection
   ```

2. Run the Python script:

   ```shell
   python mask_detection.py
   ```

   This will open your webcam and display real-time face mask detection.

3. Adjust the `bw_threshold` value in the script based on your lighting conditions for better results.
